## INTRODUCTION
The goal of this project is to look into the data collected by the US census bureau and
identify the features that have significant impact on individual's income.
There are 48,842 instances, mix of continuous and discrete records with
fifteen features. Data came originally split into (⅓ test data and ⅔ training data) which I
decided to combine them for my analysis and split them later for model development.
The following table shows a sample of the data:
